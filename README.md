1Abstract:
The development of AI-game is an integral part of artificial intelligence. Today the
gaming industry is pursuing AI based games. AI agents will be used here to play
games from computers. The AI agent will detect the imaginary flow and follow it. The
AI agent either stops the opponent or tries to win the game. This report is about AI
agent based gaming. AI gaming helps develop mental and physical skills. Making the
computer / program intelligent so that it can move intelligently like humans. Many
algorithms such as path tracking, tree, and heuristic functions can be used to create AI
agents. This project uses minimax and heuristic functions to transmit AI agents. In this
project an AI bot has been developed to play with humans. The AI agent must be
intelligent enough to compete with the human. The AI bot can try to stop the opponent
from scoring or he will try to score as much as possible to win.
2Introduction:
Artificial intelligence is making machines/programs as intelligent as humans.
Enabling the machine to think like humans. Artificial intelligence uses computers and
machines to mimic the human brain's problem-solving and decision-making abilities.
Artificial intelligence is playing a vital role in the gaming industry. An AI or bot based
game requires a lot of games. Designing games with AI is very common nowadays. In
this report we will discuss how we used AI in our snail game.
Game Requirements:
This game is designed in Python using its library arcade. This game requires any
Python with Arcade installed. If you want to play the .PY file you have to attach all
the images loaded in the game. You need to make sure that your program and all the
associated images are in one directory.
Game Rule and Goals:
➢ A sprite can move in four ways like it can only move left, right, up and down.
➢ Moving one player into a box at a time means that the player cannot jump on
the box.
➢ A player cannot move on the opposite sprite and splash.
➢ The player can move on his own splash and this process can be called slip of
sprite. In this case the player can jump on his own splashes.
➢ At the end of the game, the player who has the most splashes will win.
➢ Both players will try to cover as many boxes as possible.
➢ In case of any wrong move, the player's turn will be lost.
3How to start a new game:
When you run the program you will find a user interface that will guide you on how to
start the game. Look at the user interface message requirements to start the game.
4User Interface:
The user interface of this game is very simple and user friendly.
Illegal Moves:
If you click on a wrong place on the board, it will be considered an illegal move and
the turn will be lost. Your movement on the board has four options, top, bottom and
left and right. If you do not click on the desired box like top, bottom, left and right
then your turn will be lost and it will be considered as illegal.
5How to Win:
Winning games depends on the number of splashes . At the end of the game, the player with
the maximum number of splashes will be the winner. Getting the maximum splash depends
on your playing strategy. The AI agent is very intelligent to win against the human player so
the game is about intelligence. Human intelligence vs AI agent intelligence.
Literature Review:
Review of this game is based on developing AI agents. Most games launched a few years
ago are purely AI based games. Today the demand for this type of sport is increasing day by
day.
Movement :
The movement of players and their actions are some of the basics in AI based games.
Players can move in a way that does not affect the rules of the game.
Path Finding :
During the game it is important for both the human and the bot to find a way to defend
against the opponent's attack. Similarly, the player can find an attacking way to win.
The AI agent must be very intelligent to find the right path and can change the path in
different situations of the game. Unlike AI-based games, your sprite should not get
stuck at any stage so that it can move to attack.
6MINIMAX :
The MiniMax algorithm is well-known for teaching AI agents how to play turn-based strategy
games. The reason is that it takes into account all the possible moves that players can take
at any time during the game. With this information, it then tries to minimize the opponent's
advantage while maximizing the agents at every turn to play the AI agent. Mina and Maxi are
two players who play from their point of view.
Methodology and Implementation :
Before starting any project, one should have a structure or plan in mind as to what to do and
how to do it.
Arcade Setup :
As Python is an emerging and widely used programming language. Python is used almost all
over the world. Therefore, Python is considered to be the most suitable language for this
project. In Python we used a library called Arcade. The Arcade Library is primarily used for
2d gaming development. You need to have any Python Integrated Development
Environment installed on your computer to set up Arcade. After installing the IDE, you will
need to install pip to access the Python libraries. You will need to install the Python Arcade
Library using Pipe. After installing Arcade, you need to run the PY program on your IDE. You
need to make sure that all the attached game documents are in one directory.
